## Most accomplished

Below we look at which 5 characters from the Star Wars movies
are the most accomplished pilots (flew the greatest number of star ships):

```{r table-of-most-accomplished-pilots}
accomp_pilots <- starwars |> 
  unnest(starships) |>  
  group_by(name) |> 
  tally() %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) |> 
  head(5)

kable(accomp_pilots,
  col.names = c("Character", "Number of Starships piloted"))
```

By far, the most accomplished pilot of all is `r accomp_pilots$name[1]`. 
He is shown below piloting a star ship.
